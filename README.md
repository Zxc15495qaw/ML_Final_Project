This study proposes a method for insurance premium prediction that integrates k-means clustering, regression models, and a residual-based weighting adjustment. The approach first divides data into groups using k-means clustering, then applies separate regression models for each group, and adjusts the influence of data points with large residuals to reduce the impact of outliers. Experimental results in real insurance data sets indicate that the proposed method may offer improved prediction accuracy and stability for some categories compared to traditional regression models, providing a useful approach for handling heterogeneous data in insurance. Future research could explore alternative clustering techniques and incorporate more advanced machine learning models to further enhance performance.
